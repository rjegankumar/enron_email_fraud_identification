### Task 1: Select what features you'll use.
### features_list is a list of strings, each of which is a feature name.
### The first feature must be "poi".
features_list = ['poi','exercised_stock_options'] # You will need to use more features

### Load the dictionary containing the dataset
with open("final_project_dataset.pkl", "r") as data_file:
    data_dict = pickle.load(data_file)

### Task 2: Remove outliers
### Task 3: Create new feature(s)
### Store to my_dataset for easy export below.
del data_dict['TOTAL']
my_dataset = data_dict

### Extract features and labels from dataset for local testing
data = featureFormat(my_dataset, features_list, sort_keys = True)
labels, features = targetFeatureSplit(data)

### Task 4: Try a varity of classifiers
### Please name your classifier clf for easy export below.
### Note that if you want to do PCA or other multi-stage operations,
### you'll need to use Pipelines. For more info:
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html

# Provided to give you a starting point. Try a variety of classifiers.
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
clf = GaussianNB()

### Task 5: Tune your classifier to achieve better than .3 precision and recall 
### using our testing script. Check the tester.py script in the final project
### folder for details on the evaluation method, especially the test_classifier
### function. Because of the small size of the dataset, the script uses
### stratified shuffle split cross validation. For more info: 
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html

# Example starting point. Try investigating other evaluation techniques!
from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
import numpy as np

accuracy = []
precision = []
recall = []
f1 = []

kf = KFold(len(data), n_folds=4, random_state=1)

for train_indices, test_indices in kf:
    features_train = [features[i] for i in train_indices]
    features_test = [features[j] for j in test_indices]
    labels_train = [labels[i] for i in train_indices]
    labels_test = [labels[j] for j in test_indices]
    
    clf.fit(features_train, labels_train)
    pred = clf.predict(features_test)
    
    accuracy.append(clf.score(features_test, labels_test))
    precision.append(precision_score(labels_test, pred))
    recall.append(recall_score(labels_test, pred))
    f1.append(f1_score(labels_test, pred))
    
print "\naccuracy:", np.mean(accuracy)
print "precision:", np.mean(precision)
print "recall:", np.mean(recall)
print "f1 score:", np.mean(f1)

### Task 6: Dump your classifier, dataset, and features_list so anyone can
### check your results. You do not need to change anything below, but make sure
### that the version of poi_id.py that you submit can be run on its own and
### generates the necessary .pkl files for validating your results.
